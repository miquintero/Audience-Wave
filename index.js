// The Audience Wave is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when 
// successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms. Immediately 
// upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.

// Your task is to create a function that turns a string into an Audience Wave. You will be 
// passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is 
// a person standing up.

// The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.
// If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat.

// For example, if your input is "hello", the expected output would be:
// ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

const wave = w => {
  // your code goes here
};

module.exports = wave;
